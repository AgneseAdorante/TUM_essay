# TUM_essay
I wrote this essay for my 2024 application to TUM's Master in Mathematics in Data Science. 
Altought I ended up choosing a different path, I am particularly proud of this essay and thought it would be a waste not to share it beyond the admission committee that reviewed my documents. Hopefully, it can serve as a useful resource for future applicants. Good luck! ðŸ˜‰
